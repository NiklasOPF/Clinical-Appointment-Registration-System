The database is called "cars"

The document detailing the system can be found at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kv6hn5L3Vvv2fpYhKIrQXX0ohU-SrrdqiB0PwcKI8WI/edit?usp=sharing

# Things to note
* The persistance unit is set up in such a way that the structure of the database won't get updated if it already exists. Therefore, if you make alterations to the entity classes - you need to drop the old database before it will take effect.
